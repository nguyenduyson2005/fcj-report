During my internship at **Amazon Web Services** from **08/09/2025** to **24/12/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment. I actively engaged in a variety of technical hands-on labs and talk events, while also contributing to my group’s main project: an online platform for tracking and forecasting hurricane trajectories. Through these experiences, I significantly improved my skills in collaborative teamwork, reporting, hands-on AWS console operations, and gained a broader perspective on the current state of Cloud and AI technologies.

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:

This blog introduces how to use Stability AI Image Services within Amazon Bedrock to perform professional-grade visual editing at scale. It explains 13 tools across three categories — Edit, Upscale, and Control — enabling object removal, color replacement, style transfer, outpainting, sketch-to-image conversion, and high-quality upscaling. The article also provides a full walkthrough of setting up the environment using SageMaker AI, configuring IAM roles, running the sample notebook, and cleaning up resources. These tools help creative and marketing teams produce high-quality visual content faster, reduce costs, and unlock new creative possibilities.

###  [Blog 2 - DeepSeek-V3.1 model now available in Amazon Bedrock](3.2-Blog2/)
This blog announces that DeepSeek-V3.1 is now available as a fully managed foundation model in Amazon Bedrock. DeepSeek-V3.1 introduces a hybrid “thinking” and “non-thinking” mode, offering stronger multi-step reasoning, faster responses, and improved tool-use performance compared to DeepSeek-R1. The post highlights major gains across benchmarks, multilingual support for 100+ languages, and key use cases such as code generation, agentic tools, and enterprise applications. It also explains how to test the model inside the Bedrock console, toggle reasoning mode, run examples, and use the model via AWS CLI or SDKs. The model is available in multiple AWS Regions and automatically enabled for all AWS accounts starting October 2025.

###  [Blog 3 - Qwen models are now available in Amazon Bedrock](3.3-Blog3/)
This blog announces the arrival of Qwen3 models from Alibaba in Amazon Bedrock, expanding the platform’s selection of open-weight, fully managed foundation models. The release includes four models—two coding-focused MoE models, one general-purpose MoE model, and one dense model—each optimized for different performance and cost requirements. The article highlights key capabilities such as multi-step reasoning, tool calling, hybrid reasoning modes (thinking vs. non-thinking), and long-context handling up to 1M tokens. It also explains when to use each model based on workload needs, how to test them in the Bedrock console, and how to integrate them using AWS SDKs or agent frameworks like AgentCore. The Qwen3 models are available across multiple AWS Regions and automatically enabled for all AWS accounts starting October 2025.
